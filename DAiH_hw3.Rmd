# Prompt

Data set `books` (available in fpp2) contains the daily sales of paperback and hardcover books at
the same store. The task is to forecast the next four daysâ€™ sales for paperback and hardcover
books.

```{r}
library(fpp2)
data(books)
str(books)
```

***

### **a)** Plot the series and discuss the main features of the data.
```{r fig.align='center'}
autoplot(books, facets = TRUE) + 
  ggtitle('Daily book sales at a store') +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Books Sold") +
  expand_limits(y = c(100, 300)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1,8, 15, 22, 29, 30))
```

Both the paperback daily sales and hardcover daily sales appear to have a positive trend of increasing daily sales over time. There does not appear to be any weekly seasonality for either paperback or hardcover daily sales. 

```{r fig.align='center'}
autoplot(books) + 
  ggtitle('Daily book sales at a store') +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Books Sold") +
  expand_limits(y = c(100, 300)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1,7, 14, 21, 28, 30)) +
  coord_fixed(0.07)
```

It looks like hardcover daily sales are higher on average than paperback daily sales.

***

### **b)** Use the `ses()` function to forecast each series, and plot the forecasts.

```{r fig.align='center'}
pprbakSES = ses(books[,1], h = 4)
hrdcvrSES = ses(books[,2], h = 4)
autoplot(pprbakSES) + 
  autolayer(fitted(pprbakSES), series = "Paperback SES") + 
  ggtitle("Forecast of daily paperback sales") +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Books Sold")

autoplot(hrdcvrSES) + 
  autolayer(fitted(hrdcvrSES), series = "Hardcover SES") + 
  ggtitle("Forecast of daily hardcover sales") +
  xlab("Day") +
  ylab("Books Sold")
```


***

### **c)** Compute the RMSE values for the training data in each case.

```{r}
accuracy(pprbakSES)[1,'RMSE']
accuracy(hrdcvrSES)[1,'RMSE']
```
